# Predicting urban development with using real estate data
## Using data from [Trulia](http://trulia.com) to predict up-and-coming neighborhoods

I will be using Trulia's python scripts to get data such as average house list price and average house sale price on a neighborhood level over a 12 to 36 month period to build the prediction model.

I know that the data is contained in many layers of python dictionaries and will require a significant amount of work to get the data ready for analysis.

This topic is fascinating to me because I am interested in exploring the development of a city.
