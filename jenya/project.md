Ideas:
	* Research trends in the taxi rides
	* Design ride grading algorythm and find how ride grading correlates to other attributes.
	* Attempt to predict if higher grades improve successful ride pickup
	* Attempt to predict correlation between increased ride quantity and user behavior vs driver behavior
	* Research correlation between successful ride pickup and other trends:
		 * current marketing efforts (PR campaigns, promo codes)
		 * number of successfull fin transactions
		 * number of user_on_site (gps issues, user not showing up => driver upset and not willing to accept future rides)
		 * [!!!] tip amount the driver receives from the app user and how it affects driver's desire to accept future rides
		   	 ** do app users tip higher/lower in the app than other users that pay by cash or cc
		 * fleet trainig / overall driver rating
		 * seasonal or weather changes
		 * 

Assumptions:

Data:
	* data available for 2009 - 2014
	* data will be queried according to research needs
	* data will be available either in one or many tables
