Q: What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
A: Data is gathered from a production database. All numbers are real life data, all sensitive informaiton (user_ids, etc) will be substituted with fake values.

Q: What data have you gathered, and how did you gather it? 
A: Since there are two main groups I will be exploring for this project, I ran two queries.
	First group: User referral program. Every user has personal promo code that he/she could share with their friends or promote on their site, etc. Whenever the promo code is redeemed by a new user, both persons receive $10 credit towards their next ride.
	Second group: marketing team present various promo codes (of different dollar value) at events. Trace possible correlation between the amount and repeatative rides

	NOTE: Both groups will be bundled in one test group. There are more factors affecting first group ("friend factor"), but it also represents a group of users who receive $10 promo code

Q: What steps have you taken to explore the data? 
A: 
	* create data schema
	* modify data schema as I go through this questions and explanations
	* 

Q: Which areas of the data have you cleaned, and which areas still need cleaning? 
A: 

Q: What insights have you gained from your exploration? 
A: The query can be ran at any point. I will gather everything up to date as my test suit, and rerun the query and run my analyses on it again to confirm my hypothesis and train my model if needed.

Q: Will you be able to answer your question with this data, or do you need to gather more data (or adjust your question)? 
A: I think so. However, the result might be dissatisfactory. 

Q:  How might you use modeling to answer your question?
A:
