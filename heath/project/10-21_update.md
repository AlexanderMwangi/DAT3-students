<h3>DATA SCIENCE CLASS PROJECT

nalysis of public releases of physician payment data (Medicare Part B) and Open Payments data (Drug and Device company payments to physicians) to look for commonanlities between the data sets.

<h4>Data Sets:</h4>
2013 Open Payments data (Drug and Device companies to health care providers)
2012 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data

<h4>Question:</h4>
TBD... I want to analyze a couple of different things using the 2 data sets, if depending on what I am able to do with the information.
<ol>1) Do doctors or practice groups that charge more money per patient to Medicare, (through the use of maximizing billable payment codes) also accept more gifts from device and drug companies?
<ol>2) If doctor's are accepting more money from pharmaceutical or medical device companies, are they placing patients on more expensive brand name medications than their colleagues?
<i>CAVEAT: Must find a sub-specialty that routinely fills prescriptions for patients using an in-house pharmacy but would have basically the same costs otherwise per patient. [Possibly psychiatrists working at addiction treatment facilities]

<h4>Why:</h4>
I spent 2.5 years in medical school before deciding that I didn't actually want to be a doctor. However, I am still intrigued by the medical industry and its complicated payment methods as it relates to affordable health care. Additionally, both of these data sets were released for the first time ever in the past 12 months so there is a great deal of new information to look at.
