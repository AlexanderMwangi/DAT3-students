Question:

How can we predict overtime or minimum wage violation for restaurants in Maryland and DC based on publicly available data?

I have data from the department of labor:

http://ogesdw.dol.gov/homePage.php

I will download information for the state of Maryland 

Yelp API:
http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation
using the search function and the business information API
http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation

I will try and find yelp data for all the restaurants  that have been investigated by the federal department of labor.

I want to figure out if there is something significant in the yelp data or the dol data that is higher for violators than no violators.

I know I have to create a data set from the yelp api.
