Topic:

I'm planning to predict a Dream Team for the official Fantasy Premier League 
Football (Soccer). 

The Dream Team is a team of predicted top 11 players from the entire league based on the total individual points scored. The team can have different formations, which would lead to different combination of players in different positions. I would initially predict for 1-4-4-2 formation consisting of 1 Goalkeeper, 4 Defenders, 4 Midfielders, and 2 Strikers. I may choose either 1 of the two options below or if possible predict for both.

Option A: Dream Team for the Entire Season
Option B: Dream Team for each Round of Matches in a Season (38 rounds)

Data Cleaning: 

I have to narrow the data from the various sources to a manageable chunk. If I couldn’t find the data in a required format like CSV then I would have to use Web Scrapping to collect the data in required format. 

Interest/Audience:

I choose this topic because I’m a huge soccer fan and also have in participating in the Fantasy Premier League competition for past 3 years. With more than 2.5 million registered users, the fantasy league is a million dollar (if not billion) industry. This can be a good guide for users to pick their teams with the highest total score potential.
